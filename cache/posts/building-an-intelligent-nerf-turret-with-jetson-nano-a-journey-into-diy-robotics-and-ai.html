<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>Imagine transforming a simple toy into an intelligent machine that recognises and interacts with its environment. That's exactly what I set out to do with a Nerf turret. The journey began with a desire to create something fun and educational for my son and me, and it evolved into an exploration of open-source hardware, machine learning, and robotics.</p>

<h1>The Beginning: Assembling the Turret</h1>
<p>The project started with an open-source Nerf turret design</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.littlefrenchkev.com/bluetooth-nerf-turret">https://www.littlefrenchkev.com/bluetooth-nerf-turret</a></p>
<p>I printed all the parts using a 3D printer and got to work.</p>
<p>The assembly involved soldering components, integrating Arduino and servo motors for movement control, and programming the turret based on a project from the LittleFrenchKev website.</p>
<p>This initial phase was to explain basic electronics and programming to my son.</p>

<h1>From Manual to Autonomous: The Leap into AI</h1>
<p>After playing with the manually controlled turret, I realised the potential to make it autonomous and &quot;intelligent.&quot;</p>
<p>The challenge was to enable the turret to recognise and target objects autonomously.</p>
<p>With a background in basic OpenCV and Tesseract from a decade ago, I decided to delve deeper into machine learning.</p>

<section id="the-decision-why-jetson-nano">
<h1>The Decision: Why Jetson Nano?</h1>
<p>The offline Image recognitions options had to involve specialised hardware options were:  Jetson Nano, Google Coral, and Intel CS.</p>
<p>I chose Jetson Nano for its balance of accessibility, power, and community support.</p>
<p>With its AI/ML Jetpack and 128-core GPU, Jetson Nano is the perfect fit for someone reentering the world of AI and machine learning.</p>

<h1>The Upgrade: Image Recognition and Servo Control</h1>
<p>Initially, I planned to use a Kinect camera for its depth-sensing capabilities.</p>
<p>However, I encountered compatibility issues with the Python version of the Jetson Nano Nvidia-customised ubuntu version.</p>
<p>So, I switched to a full HD Logitech camera.
I asked ChatGPT for help in using the camera for person detection and received comprehensive guidance, including code snippets and suggestions to use Nvidia's pre-trained models for person detection.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://chat.openai.com/share/1120521a-1042-4971-9e33-a852b85178f5">https://chat.openai.com/share/1120521a-1042-4971-9e33-a852b85178f5</a></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://chat.openai.com/share/8ace3024-bcc9-44c1-a08a-7a5658a0e3e3">https://chat.openai.com/share/8ace3024-bcc9-44c1-a08a-7a5658a0e3e3</a></p>
<p>The implementation succeeded â€“ the turret could now recognise a person using the Logitech camera.</p>

<h1>Integrating AI with Mechanics</h1>
<p>The next step was to translate the detected coordinates into servo movements.</p>
<p>I slightly modified the existing application to transform it into a web API that could accept coordinates.</p>
<p>This meant that the turret was not just a passive observer but could actively interact with its environment.</p>
<p>To add an interactive element, I created a simple HTML interface where the turret's movement followed the mouse cursor. A click would prompt the turret to &quot;shoot.&quot;</p>
<p>WITH HELP OF CHATGPT!</p>
<img alt="/images/1.jpg" src="/images/1.jpg" />
<img alt="/images/2.jpg" src="/images/2.jpg" />
<p>After launching and accessing application of course I had some CORS errors</p>
<p>but if I didnt know whats <a class="reference external" href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/csrf">CORS</a> I could still just paste error to get answer from chatgpt -SCARY!</p>
<img alt="/images/4.jpg" src="/images/4.jpg" />
<img alt="/images/5.jpg" src="/images/5.jpg" />
<p>Later I wanted the turret to follow my mouse live.
NOTE If we are without Architectual mind sending mouse coordinates changes through http API is crazy this would load server- but hapilly Chatgpt TELLS US ABOUT IT!!! just in case we have no infrastructure application workflow experience.)</p>
<img alt="/images/8.jpg" src="/images/8.jpg" />
<p>What it didnt suggest is that for this specific usecase best would be to use websockets.</p>

<p>This feature made the turret a demonstration of AI and robotics and an engaging toy.</p>

<h1>Conclusion: More Than Just a Toy</h1>
<p>This project was a journey through various domains:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>3D printing</p></li>
<li><p>electronics</p></li>
<li><p>programming</p></li>
<li><p>AI</p></li>
<li><p>robotics</p></li>
</ul>
<p>It was a learning experience fueled by curiosity and the desire to create something unique. The Nerf turret, now equipped with AI capabilities, stands as a testament to the power of open-source projects and the accessibility of modern technology.
What started as a fun project with my son became a gateway into the fascinating world of AI and robotics, demonstrating that anyone can step into the world of DIY AI projects with curiosity and the right tools.</p>
